# The Higher or Lower Game

Welcome to the Higher or Lower Game! This simple and addictive game challenges your ability to guess which search term has been searched for the most. Inspired by the popular website [The Higher Lower Game](https://www.higherlowergame.com/), my version brings the excitement to your command line.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Get the most consecutive guesses right.

2. **Rules**: 
    - You are presented with two search terms.
    - Decide which term you think has been searched for more.
    - Choose 'higher' or 'lower' accordingly.

3. **Scoring**:
    - For each correct guess, your streak increases.
    - A wrong guess ends your streak.

4. **Game Over**:
    - The game ends when you make an incorrect guess.
    - Your highest streak is recorded.
