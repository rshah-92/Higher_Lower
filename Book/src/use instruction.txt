Sparky's Books Login and Registration System

This program allows users to log in, register, and reset their password for the Sparky's Books. The user information is stored in an external text file named `login_information.txt`.

Instructions:
1. When you run the program, the login screen will appear.
   - Enter your email and password to log in.
   - If your credentials are correct, a message will confirm a successful login.
   - If you donâ€™t have an account, click the "Register Now" button to go to the registration page.

2. On the registration page:
   - Fill in your first name, last name, email, and password (password must be at least 8 characters).
   - Click "Create Account" to register.
   - If registration is successful, the program will return to the login screen, and you can log in with your new credentials.

3. If you forgot your password:
   - Click on the "Forgot Password?" link from the login page.
   - Enter your email and the temporary password (`1234` by default).
   - You will be asked to set a new password.

File Descriptions:
- `login.java`: The main Java file containing the program code for the login, registration, and password reset.
- `login_information.txt`: The text file where user information (email, name, and password) is saved. It will be created if it doesn't exist during the first run.
